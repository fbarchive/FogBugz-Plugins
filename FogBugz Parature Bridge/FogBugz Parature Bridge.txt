FogBugz Parature Bridge
Version 1.0.0.1

A Fogbugz Plugin to update Parature when updates occured to linked bugz.

Our customer support personnel use a product called Parature to manage our incoming support cases. Development prefers Fogbugz, and we don't want Support in there, messing with our Bugz. So, we built a bridge between the two systems, and query for Parature cases that need to be updated when our referenced Bugz are edited.

This version requires FogBugz 7.3 or higher.
