Dependencies
Version 1.0.0.12

Adds dependency support for cases

The FogBugz Dependency Plugin adds functionality to FogBugz to enable dependencies between cases: 

• Dependencies between cases can be added via the case view 
• Cases can be filtered on the number of cases they are (directly) blocking 
• Cases can be filtered on the number of unclosed dependencies 
• Cases can be automatically reopened if closed with unmet dependencies 
• Cases can be automatically reactivated when all dependencies are closed 

Quarantainenet has released the Dependency Plugin under a BSD license. 

In the ZIP-file, you'll find end user and developer manuals, as well as the full Visual Studio C# project.

This version requires FogBugz 7.3 or higher.
