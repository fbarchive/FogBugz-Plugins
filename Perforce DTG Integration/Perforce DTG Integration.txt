Perforce DTG Integration
Version 1.0.3

Allows integration with Perforce through the Perforce Defect Tracking Gateway.

Allows deep integration between Perforce and FogBugz by mirroring FogBugz cases as Perforce Jobs. Using this plugin you can: 

* View FogBugz case details in Perforce 
* Easily apply fixes to cases using Perforce without having to remember the case number 
* See changelists in FogBugz and view them using P4Web 

This plugin requires installation of the Perforce Defect Tracking Gateway (p4dtg).

This version requires FogBugz 7.3 or higher.
