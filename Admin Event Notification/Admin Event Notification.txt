Admin Event Notification
Version 1.1

Forward admin notifications to e-mails and/or cases

Allow for better monitoring of your FogBugz install, especially if the admin account is not used on a regular basis. 

This plugin has the following functions: 

- Send an email when an admin notification is triggered in FogBugz 
- Send an email when an admin notification is resolved in FogBugz (manually or automatically resolved) 
- Create a case when an admin notification is triggered in FogBugz; the case will be updated when the admin notification is resolved (manually or automatically resolved) 

Each of these options can be individually enabled or disabled in the plugin configuration

This version requires FogBugz 8.6.50 or higher.
