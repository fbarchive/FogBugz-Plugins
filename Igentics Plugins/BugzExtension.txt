BugzExtension
Version 1

This plugin extends the Bug details by allowing you to add time intervals (from 30 mins up to whatever you want) against a bug. I wrote this plugin because we needed to be able to schedule when developers were going to work on tasks rather than just give them a deadlin.

This version requires FogBugz 7.3 or higher.
