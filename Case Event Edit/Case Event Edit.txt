Case Event Edit
Version 1.1.1.28

Enables editing of existing case events.

You can now edit existing case events! Fix typos, modify bug descriptions, add new repro steps, and more! 

All edits to every event are saved in your FogBugz case history, so you can make changes and fix mistakes without needing to worry about losing any important history.

This version requires FogBugz 8.7.57 or higher.
