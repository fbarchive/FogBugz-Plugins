Wiki Comments
Version 1.0.13

Add commenting functionality to wiki articles.

Wiki Comments integrates with the FogBugz 8 Wiki to provide a lightweight commenting feature for wiki articles. 

Inserting Wiki Comments into an article provides a mechanism for readers to share their thoughts and have discussions without needing to edit the article itself.

This version requires FogBugz 8.0.32 or higher.
