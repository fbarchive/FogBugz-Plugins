Organizations
Version 0.8.6.470

Adds an organization field to Fogbugz cases.

About Organizations: 

Organizations is a very simple plugin that adds a hierarchal layer on top of projects in Fogbugz. In the same way that a project has a set of areas, an organization contains a set of projects. 

An organization is very similar to the Fogbugz group. The reason this plugin doesn't simply add to the functionality of groups is because all projects in a Fogbugz group share the same user access permissions. This plugin does not enforce visibility or access permissions based on a users organization, and it will never breach any Fogbugz group security settings. So you may use Organizations to classify your projects, and Fogbugz groups to establish user permissions for them. 



Plugin Compatibility: 

Due to extensive use of Javascript for manipulating the bug display page, backward and forward compatibility of this plugin is not guaranteed. The organizations plugin is currently compatible with: 

Version 8.6.50 (DB 786, Build 0) 



Plugin Features: 

- When creating a new case, a drop-down menu containing your organizations will appear before the project drop-down. The project drop-down gets sorted based on the selected organization, just like how the area drop-down is sorted based on project. 
- Users can designate themselves as being part of a particular organization. 
- You may filter by organization. 
- A new case template system. These are text templates that can pre-populate your new case description field based on the selected organization of the case. 



Configuring Organizations: 

- Once you have the plugin installed, go to Admin -> Configure Organizations. 
- Scroll down to 'Add an Organization' and add your desired organization names. 
- Then go to 'Link a Project with an Organization', and pair all of your projects with their respective organizations. Note: If you don't link all of your projects with an organization, then the organizations drop-down menu will not appear! This is to keep projects from becoming inaccessible. 
- You may now add new case templates for your organizations if you desire. 

This version requires FogBugz 7.3 or higher.
