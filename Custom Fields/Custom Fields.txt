Custom Fields
Version 1.2.7

Allows administrators to add custom fields to cases

If the case fields provided by FogBugz don't quite serve your needs, use the 
Custom Fields Plugin to add a new one in a matter of minutes. The field can be any of several types including text, drop-down, and date/time. 

Once the custom field is created, you'll be able to edit the new field in the case view, see a new column in the grid view, and even filter results by possible field values.

This version requires FogBugz 8.3.42 or higher.
