Code Snippets
Version 1.0.0.25

Embed syntax-highlighted code snippets into wiki articles and bug events

Adds the ability to embed syntax-highlighted code snippets into wiki articles, bug events, and Kiln code reviews. 

When editing a case, just wrap your code snippet in [code] ... [/code] or <code> ... </code> tags and you're all set! 

When editing a wiki article select Insert -> Code Snippet. 

To create inline code snippets, just keep everything on a single line: <code>my inline snippet</code>. 

Kiln (v2.2 and later) now supports code snippets as well! Just use the same tags as you would in FogBugz and everything should just work!

This version requires FogBugz 8.2.22 or higher.
