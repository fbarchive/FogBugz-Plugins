Wiki Article Index
Version 1.7

An insertable article index for your wikis.

This plugin adds a widget that you can insert into a FogBugz wiki to display an article index. 

It is very similar to the Fog Creek "Wiki Page Table of Contents" plugin, except that it creates a table of contents listing all articles in the wiki, instead of a listing of headers within the same wiki article.

This version requires FogBugz 8.4.87 or higher.
