Wider Cases
Version 1.1

Makes the individual case view wider than the default

The FogBugz individual case view too narrow for you? This plugin will make it 25% wider so it better fills your wide-screen monitor. 

Wider Cases shouldn't be used with FogBugz 7.3+ since it clashes with FogBugz 7.3's case resize ability.

This version requires FogBugz 7.0 or higher.
