Notify
Version 1.0.1.7

Adds a 'Notify More Users' field on case edits, allowing you to send changes and an edit message to more users.

Traditionally, notification messages about changes only go to the assignee of the case and any subscribers. The Notify plugin allows the editor to notify any other FogBugz user of the change.

This version requires FogBugz 8.2.22 or higher.
